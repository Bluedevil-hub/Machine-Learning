Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be\n","assisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.\n","\n","MARGARET ATWOOD\n","\n","\"The Handmaid's Tale\"\n","A story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously\n","assassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it\n","\"right\" again.  The book is the diary of a woman's life as she tries to live\n","under the new Christian theocracy.  Women's right to own property is revoked,\n","and their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the\n","radio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished\n","retroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the \"old world\" are\n","hunted down and hanged.  Atwood's writing style is difficult to get used to\n","at first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.\n","\n","VARIOUS AUTHORS\n","\n","\"The Bible\"\n","This somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.

In this\n","work, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the\n","existence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely\n","upon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and\n","aesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were\n","decisively rejected in Mackie's \"The Miracle of Theism\".  In the revised\n","edition of \"The Existence of God\", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he\n","makes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.\n","\n","J. L. MACKIE\n","\n","\"The Miracle of Theism\", Oxford\n","This (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal\n","arguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical\n","philosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through\n","the moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements\n","of the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those\n","positions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational,\n","such as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as \"replacements for\n","God\" such as Lelie's axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - less\n","formalistic and better written than Martin's works, and refreshingly direct\n","when compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.\n","\n","JAMES A.

civil strength militias fighting each side should reflect popular will public split versus then minorities militias should disadvantage such need popular support would hopefully prevent insurrections unless people really were behind rebels heavy weapons owned small fraction militia could distort what minority included tank artillery owners that seems case already given that heavy weapons commonly owned citizenry with such numbers obviously cost think superior weapons going great effect against numerically superior furthermore even more doubtful their training includes proper tactical movements that best utilize tanks whereas commonly rifleman hampered effectiveness think vital avoid such situation where small minority would have reasonable chance gaining political power through violence prevent this necessary give control heavy weapons those which only small number individuals would whose firepower would grossly distort relation between popular support military strength someone other that individual militiamen this certainly good thing think lesser evils whoever controls these weapons must democratic body responsive will people envisioned that armorer perhaps officers select group

militia arms have several levels government each able independently likely targets rebelion such rebelions against state local governments very unlikely think therefore that state governments could safely allowed keep select militia heavy weapons risk abuse while still something consider less than similar risk were federal government control this will agree with point state having control over heavy weapons should justification state have them centrally located keep them spread such that ability state lock them easy otherwise would have assume that state control would rest authority governor militia officers that eaxctly think they should select militia should privide militia heavy weapons highly trained specialists reasons have outlines above think these heavy weapons better

militia under direction democratic local governments would opperate together even worst case general militia should able functional without select militia similarly select militia should incapable action without general militia having hard time seeing these heavy weapons fairly numbers could easily wielded people with government support just argued above that weapons should divvied under democratic control side does have them where this situation alleviated having select militia holding weapons unorganized militia being infantry think better called would argue that federal army should rely upon select militia unorganized militia bulk infantry units consider then effect removing infantry placing guard under control local governments government controled select militia could fight effectively without infantry support provided general militia other hand general militia could function although disadvantage without backing local governments select militia have assume that there
